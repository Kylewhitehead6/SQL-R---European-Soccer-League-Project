This project is meant to analyze soccer data in Europes Top 5 European League from the 09/10 season to the 18/19 season. The idea is touch on the competitiveness of each league. What does competitive actually mean? 

Competitiveness is a vague term - we will look at winners, top 4 contenders and points earned from the bottom teams from the top teams to compare whether one league really shines or dulls compared to the others. 

This analysis is conducted using a combination of R programming & SQL. Please view the code file if you want a more in-depth look at my code. This markdown file will only present final outputs such as tables & graphs.
