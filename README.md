# SQL-R---European-Soccer-League-Project

To see results without the code, please select the markdown_md.md file as this is a markdown file compatible with github to show results. It does not show some of the tables in the format as it would on an HTML output, but it gives the tables nevertheless. Otherwise, code will have to be cloned to your versions of R and run to get the results in a nice HTML format. 

This project is meant to analyze soccer data in Europes Top 5 European League from the 09/10 season to the 18/19 season. The idea is touch on the competitiveness of each league. What does competitive actually mean? 

Competitiveness is a vague term - we will look at winners, top 4 contenders and points earned from the bottom teams from the top teams to compare whether one league really shines or dulls compared to the others. 

This analysis is conducted using a combination of R programming & SQL. Please view the code file if you want a more in-depth look at my code. This markdown file will only present final outputs such as tables & graphs.
